# VN2K_WGS84
A small script supporting GIS and RS technicians in converting between Vietnamese national coordinate system (VN2000) and WGS84 back and forth. I adopted the codes in Python GDAL/OGR Cookbook and inherited codes by Br. Elias Max KÃ¶nig. Links to these sources are listed in reference.
The transformation applies Molodensky Badekas method with 7 transformation parameters. These parameters were adopted from the report by Luyen et al. (2014).
